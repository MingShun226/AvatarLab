# AI Images Module - Setup Instructions

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

The AI Images module has been fully implemented with multi-provider support, automatic saving, and download functionality. Here's what you need to do to get it running.

## 📋 What Has Been Implemented

### ✅ Backend (Supabase Edge Functions)
- **generate-image-unified**: Universal edge function supporting multiple AI providers
  - OpenAI DALL-E 3 (sync - immediate results)
  - Stability AI (sync - immediate results)
  - KIE AI Flux (async - progress polling)

### ✅ Frontend (React)
- **ImagesSection.tsx**: Completely redesigned UI with:
  - Provider selection dropdown
  - Prompt and negative prompt inputs
  - Real-time progress tracking
  - Gallery with download, favorite, and delete actions
  - Responsive grid layout

### ✅ Service Layer
- **imageGeneration.ts**: Complete service abstraction for all image operations
  - Generate, poll, save, delete, download, favorite
  - Type-safe interfaces

### ✅ Database
- **Migration**: `20251007000000_add_image_generation_providers.sql`
  - Added `provider`, `model`, `parameters` columns to `generated_images`
  - Created `image_generation_queue` table for async operations
  - Added RLS policies and indexes

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

Run the migration to update your database schema:

```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or apply manually in Supabase Dashboard
# Go to SQL Editor and run the migration file:
# supabase/migrations/20251007000000_add_image_generation_providers.sql
```

### Step 2: Configure API Keys

You need to add API keys as environment variables in your Supabase project:

#### Option A: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Project Settings** > **Edge Functions** > **Secrets**
3. Add the following secrets:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
STABILITY_API_KEY=sk-...
KIE_AI_API_KEY=...
```

#### Option B: Local Development (.env.local)
If testing locally with Supabase CLI:

```bash
# Create/edit supabase/.env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
STABILITY_API_KEY=sk-...
KIE_AI_API_KEY=...
```

### Step 3: Deploy Edge Function

Deploy the new unified edge function:

```bash
# Deploy generate-image-unified function
supabase functions deploy generate-image-unified

# If you want to keep the old function as fallback
supabase functions deploy generate-image

# If using Supabase Dashboard:
# The function will be auto-deployed when you push the code
```

### Step 4: Test the Implementation

1. Navigate to the Images Studio page in your app
2. Select an AI provider (start with OpenAI DALL-E 3)
3. Enter a prompt (e.g., "A serene mountain landscape at sunset")
4. Click "Generate Image"
5. Watch the progress indicator
6. Image should appear in the gallery when complete
7. Test download, favorite, and delete functionality

## 🔑 Getting API Keys

### OpenAI DALL-E 3 (Recommended - Best Quality)
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create a new API key
3. Cost: ~$0.04-0.08 per image (1024x1024)
4. **Add credit balance** to your OpenAI account

**Format**: `sk-proj-...` or `sk-...`

### Stability AI (Alternative - Good for Art)
1. Go to https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys
2. Create a new API key
3. Cost: ~$0.003-0.01 per image
4. **Add credit balance** to your Stability AI account

**Format**: `sk-...`

### KIE AI (Fallback - Already Configured)
- You should already have this configured from previous implementations
- If not, get one from https://kie.ai

## 🎨 Provider Comparison

| Provider | Speed | Quality | Cost | Best For |
|----------|-------|---------|------|----------|
| **OpenAI DALL-E 3** | Fast (5-10s) | Excellent | $0.04-0.08 | Photorealistic, natural language |
| **Stability AI** | Fast (3-7s) | Very Good | $0.003-0.01 | Artistic, creative styles |
| **KIE AI Flux** | Slow (20-60s) | Good | Varies | Budget option, artistic |

## 📱 User Interface Features

### Generate Tab
- **Provider Selection**: Dropdown with descriptions
- **Prompt Input**: Large text area for detailed prompts
- **Negative Prompt**: Optional - specify what to avoid
- **Progress Bar**: Real-time generation progress (for async providers)
- **Generate Button**: Large, prominent CTA

### Gallery Tab
- **Grid Layout**: Responsive 1-3 columns
- **Hover Actions**: Download, favorite, delete buttons
- **Image Info**: Prompt preview, provider badge, date
- **Empty State**: Helpful message with CTA to generate

### Download Functionality
- Click download icon on any image
- Saves as `ai-image-{id}.png`
- Works with all image formats

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "API key not configured" error
**Solution**: Make sure you've added the API key to Supabase secrets and redeployed the edge function

### Issue: "Authentication required" error
**Solution**: User must be logged in. Check auth state in the app

### Issue: Generation timeout
**Solution**:
- Check API key is valid and has credits
- Try a different provider
- Check Supabase function logs for errors

### Issue: Image not appearing in gallery
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify database migration was applied
- Check RLS policies allow user to read their images

### Issue: Download not working
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Ensure image URL is accessible
- Try right-click > Save Image As

## 📊 Monitoring & Logs

### Supabase Function Logs
```bash
# View logs for debugging
supabase functions logs generate-image-unified

# Or in Supabase Dashboard:
# Go to Edge Functions > generate-image-unified > Logs
```

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Check generated images
SELECT * FROM generated_images ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check generation queue (for async providers)
SELECT * FROM image_generation_queue ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check by provider
SELECT provider, COUNT(*) FROM generated_images GROUP BY provider;
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add More Providers**
   - Replicate (multiple models)
   - Midjourney (if API available)
   - Leonardo AI

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Image-to-image generation
   - Batch generation (multiple variations)
   - Style presets
   - Aspect ratio selection
   - Image upscaling

3. **Collections**
   - Organize images into collections
   - Share collections with others
   - Export collections

4. **Admin Panel**
   - Usage analytics
   - Cost tracking per provider
   - User quotas

## 💰 Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Use Stability AI for bulk generation** (cheaper)
2. **Use OpenAI for final high-quality outputs**
3. **Implement caching** to avoid regenerating similar prompts
4. **Set user quotas** to control costs
5. **Monitor usage** with database queries
