# 🔧 Fix: Memories Returning 0

## 🔴 Problem
You created a memory but API returns:
```json
"memories": { "count": 0, "items": [] }
```

## 🎯 Root Cause
The Edge Function was querying **columns that don't exist** in the database!

**Edge Function was trying to select:**
```typescript
memory_details,      // ❌ Doesn't exist
emotional_context    // ❌ Doesn't exist
```

**Actual database columns:**
```sql
memory_description,  // ✅ Exists
mood,                // ✅ Exists
location,            // ✅ Exists
food_items,          // ✅ Exists
activities,          // ✅ Exists
conversational_hooks // ✅ Exists
```

## ✅ Fix Applied

Updated the Edge Function to query **only existing columns**:

```typescript
// Now queries correct fields:
memory_description,
location,
people_present,
activities,
food_items,
mood,
conversational_hooks,
is_favorite,
is_private
```
