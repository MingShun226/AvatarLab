## Issue
`better-sqlite3` requires Visual Studio build tools on Windows, which can be complex to install and configure.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: IndexedDB with Dexie.js (Recommended)
**Benefits:**
- No build tools required
- Works in all browsers
- Excellent performance
- Similar API to SQLite
- Built-in TypeScript support

### Option 2: SQL.js (SQLite in WebAssembly)
**Benefits:**
- True SQLite compatibility
- No native compilation
- Works everywhere
- Can export/import .sqlite files

### Option 3: Install Visual Studio Build Tools
**For users who want to keep better-sqlite3:**
- Install Visual Studio Build Tools
- Or use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

## Recommended Implementation: Dexie.js

### Advantages:
1. **Zero setup** - No build tools needed
2. **Better for web apps** - Designed for browsers
3. **Excellent TypeScript support**
4. **Reactive queries** - Auto-updating UI
5. **Offline-first** - Perfect for PWAs
6. **Cross-platform** - Works on all devices

### Performance Comparison:
